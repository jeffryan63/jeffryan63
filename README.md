# Hi, I'm Jeff Ryan ðŸ‘‹

Director of R&D at Fireball Industries | Mechanical Engineering â€¢ Tool & Die â€¢ Automation â€¢ Industrial Design â€¢ Robotics â€¢ Controls â€¢ Machining â€¢ Drafting

I use GitHub as a core tool for R&Dâ€”prototyping ideas, collaborating on open-source, and sharing practical, production-ready resources. Most of my public work is released under the MIT License to encourage wide adoption and iteration.

## ðŸ”§ Domains & Proficiencies

- Mechanical Engineering
- Tool & Die Design and Fabrication
- Industrial Automation and Systems Integration
- Industrial/Product Design (DFM/DFA)
- Robotics (mechanisms, actuation, motion systems)
- Controls Engineering (PLC, motion control, sensors)
- CNC Machining, Fabrication, and Rapid Prototyping
- Technical Drafting and Documentation

---

## ðŸ§ª What Youâ€™ll Find Here

- Open-source utilities, tooling, and reference designs
- Practical examples for robotics and automation
- CAD/Drafting templates and best practices
- Controls snippets, motion profiles, and integration notes
- Manufacturing workflows and process documentation

Where possible, I prioritize:
- Practicality over theory
- Repeatability and maintainability
- Clear documentation and standards

---

## ðŸ”¬ R&D Focus Areas

- Mechatronic system design and optimization
- Fixture design, tolerancing, and manufacturability
- Motion systems (linear/rotary) and kinematics
- Robust controls architectures for industrial environments
- Automation cells: safety, reliability, and throughput
- Design-for-manufacture and cost-effective scaling
